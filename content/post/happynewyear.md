Hi friends!

It's hard to believe another year has come and gone. Over the next two weeks you
should see some announcements regarding the upcoming meetup. There are a few things
I need first from you, the community.

1. A meeting place. Somewhere in Nashville, preferably in the Downtown Area.
2. A meeting sponsor. Food and Drinks (alcohol is not necessary) for ~12-20 people.
3. A speaker and topic. This one is optional, if there are no volunteers I'll put together
a talk.

Just a word about future meetups, I intend on going monthly with the Gophers by the end
of the year, in order to do so I'll definitely need volunteers for speaking, organizing,
and leading discussion groups. I'll be posting more in the future.

In the meantime, feel free to reach out to me on slack (@kcrawley)
