Hello! Welcome to the new Nashville Gophers web site.

My name is Kevin Crawley. I've used Go for several internal and open source projects over the past year and have contributed to projects like Kubernetes and Terraform. When I looked around for fellow Nashville Gophers, I was alone. I realized I didn't have to be and that's why I'm organizing the Nashville Gophers very first meetup! I look forward to meeting all of you and hearing about your experiences and interests.

I am going to be honest with _everyone_. I am not a web designer. It's been years since I've touched CSS/layouts. At some point in my career I remember being good at it but I'm not anymore. I'll **gladly** accept contributions.

This web site is being generated by Hugo. Eventually it will have an API component which will be written in Go. I will be posting the code to our Github repository for contributions. I encourage presenters to submit PRs with their slides and materials. My plan going forward is to post slidedecks and recordings of talks to the blog.

Cheers! I look forward to meeting all of you in February!
